# Unified Guide: PPT + Invariant Testing System for AI-Assisted and Complex Projects

This guide provides a lightweight, enforceable, and extensible framework that combines **Predictive Property-Based Testing (PPT)** with **runtime invariant enforcement**. It's designed for teams or solo devs working in high-churn, AI-assisted, or exploratory projects that still demand test rigor and architectural discipline.

---

## Core Concept

Traditional TDD fails under high-change systems. This system embraces volatility by:

1. **Focusing on Properties**, not implementations.
2. **Embedding Invariants** directly into business logic.
3. **Automating Test Lifecycle** to prevent test bloat.
4. **Tracking Invariant Coverage** to enforce contract-level guarantees.

## Layered Test System Overview

| Layer  | Description                                    | Enforced With                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| E-Test | Exploration (temporary)                        | `explore_test()` or free tests |
| P-Test | Property test (generic input, stable behavior) | `property_test()` + invariants |
| C-Test | Contract (permanent, must-pass)                | `contract_test()` + tracking   |

## Invariant System Summary

### Define Invariants in Code

```rust
assert_invariant(payment.amount > 0, "Payment must be positive", Some("checkout flow"));
```

- **Logs the assertion**
- **Crashes on violation**
- **Records presence** for later contract checks

### Track Them in Contract Tests

```rust
contract_test("payment processing", &["Payment must be positive"]);
```

### Reset Between Runs (Optional CI Cleanup)

```rust
clear_invariant_log();
```

---

## How It Guides AI or Human Developers

- **Invariant Failures** give immediate semantic feedback.
- **Property Tests** ensure robustness across inputs.
- **Contract Tests** enforce that critical rules are still checked after refactors or codegen.
- **No test passes unless the real-world expectations are still actively enforced.**

## Setup and Tooling (Rust)

### Add Dependency

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
lazy_static = "1.4"
```

### Include System

```rust
mod invariant_ppt;
use invariant_ppt::*;
```

### Suggested File Layout

```
src/
  invariant_ppt.rs
  logic.rs
  tests/
    mod.rs
    test_properties.rs
    test_contracts.rs
```

## Expansion Ideas

- **CI contract coverage audit**: fail if key invariants are missing.
- **Property test fuzzing**: integrate with proptest/quickcheck.
- **Cross-language parity**: reuse concept in TS, Python, Go.
- **IDE plugins**: mark critical paths without invariants.

---

## Why Use This

- Forces you to **define real expectations**, not just examples.
- Helps AI systems learn and conform to those expectations.
- Protects your system’s **semantic integrity during rapid iteration**.
- Eliminates “silent failure” drift across modules.

---

## Minimal Startup Checklist

- Register a `PptManager` and call `capture_baseline()` after your first successful pipeline run.
- Add `check_regression()` to your CI pipeline validation step.
- Review `PptReport` on any deployment that changes stage count or processing logic.
